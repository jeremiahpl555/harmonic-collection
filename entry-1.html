    <p>Sensory details - Subway to Museum</p>
    <p>There are quite a few sensory details that I found myself fixated on in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBVDQY8Gygc"target="_self">subway</a>. I was on my way to the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/"target="_self">American Museum of Natural History</a> and had to hop on and off a few trains. Constantly looking at my <a href="https://google.com/maps/@40.7260913,-73.9946091,4109m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOS4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"target="_self">google maps</a> and rereading my next <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195714/"target="_self">destination</a>, there were small intervals in between where I would be at a new subway station for a couple of minutes. Each time, I noticed different sensory elements. For example, at my stop at <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/greeley-square-park"target="_self">Greeneley Square</a>, there seemed to be more air currents and wind blowing in the specific spot I was standing at. There were less people around as well. 
      
      This heavily contrasted from my initial starting spot at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Street_(Manhattan)"target="_self">14th St</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Square,_Manhattan"target="_self">Union Square</a> which can be overstimulating with a larger crowd of people and more trains overall. I specifically paid attention to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3K5bt8NbN0"target="_self">sounds</a> of different subway stations. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss2hULhXf04"target="_self">Conversations</a> between people, the <a href="https://www.avosound.com/en/sound-effects/search/train/train-new-york-city/"target="_self">crushing sound</a> of the train tracks when a train would pass, announcements on speakers, and the occasional singing or instruments from people that perform in the subways. While each subway has its own atmosphere, a lot of the sensory details overlap to create one collective sensory experience that encapsulates a crucial part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"target="_self">New York City</a>. </p>
    
    </h3> 

      <h4>Takeaways - 
        
        <h4> Sounds: train tracks, people talking, voice on speakers, music, rumbling - created a nice ambience reminiscent of listening to white/brown noise </h4>
        <h4> Smells: copper/metallic, smoke, earthy smells </h4>
        <h4> Sights: train tracks, trains, people on trains, people within subway station, poles, low ceilings, dust, rats, escalators, elevators, tiles, staircases, light peaking from outside </h4>
        <h4> Touch: seats on train, poles on train, doors on train, walls </h4>
        <h4> Taste: N/A </h4></h4>
    
        <h3> Museum Arrival </h3>

        <p> There’s a stark difference between the sensory details of the outside park and walking into the museum. Being close in proximity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park"target="_self">Central Park</a>, there’s a very <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/mfallis2254/lime-green/"target="_self">bright green color</a> from the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/greenleafmktg/green-leaves/"target="_self">leaves</a> that blends into the environment outside. It was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgr4sGq2ba0"target="_self">sunny day</a> with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK25liGte9g"target="_self">slight breeze</a>. The museums <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/wwcherylww/high-ceilings/"target="_self">high ceilings</a> and large rooms felt very spacious which had a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/dreamvoid/liminal-spaces/"target="_self">liminal</a> or <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/marthabarce1123/haunting/"target="_self">haunting</a> feel. This was emphasized through the historical pieces of art throughout. Most of the lighting within the rooms was <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/dim-lighting/952016509513/"target="_self">dim</a> with brighter lights illuminating towards the artifacts on display. Most of the museum was cool with some rooms colder than others. There was a room near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"target="_self">Central America</a> area that was playing a distinct type of music that had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOY6iSmxoI8"target="_self">wind chime</a> feel, adding to the pieces and overall atmosphere. I found myself enjoying the space because of the intimacy created with the lights and being near an artifact or reading the text that accompanied some. At certain points there were <a href="https://www.storyblocks.com/video/search/crowd"target="_self">crowds</a> of people in smaller spaces which was slightly distracting. Ultimately, I reflected on the sensory experiences of museums as a whole and never realized how the different elements are mostly intentionally made to make people react or engage in a specific way.
