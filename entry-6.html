<p> 
  This was my first time attending <a href="https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden" target="_self">Madison Square Garden</a> in NYC, arguably one of the most popular arenas in the entire world. I was very excited to see the artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_Gray" target="_self">Conan Gray</a> perform, as I’ve been listening to his music for so many years and I’d never seen him perform live. His music is very authentic lyrically and diverse sonically. While he makes pop music, he taps into different sub categories of indie, rock, and alternative styles with his most recent album taking inspiration from the pinnacle of 80s pop. He’s also relatively known for his fashion, having one of the most liked <a href="https://www.instagram.com/conangray/p/CrvdGR7Ov3P/?img_index=1" target="_self">MET Gala looks in 2023</a>. As someone who discovered his music during his rise as a teenager, I heavily resonated with his vulnerability in retelling his personal experiences in his music. Growing up with an artist that you admire and relate to can be inspiring, which made me want to see him in person even more. Also his vocal range is phenomenal and arguably one of the most unique in the music industry. He’s quite underrated, which may seem odd to say as he’s selling out arenas but people rarely mention Conan in the pop culture space with other similar artists.  </p>
<p> The day of the concert was quite busy for me. I had three in person classes and after that, I had to get ready for the concert, and take the subway to MSG which was about 20 minutes away from where I lived. I left around 7 and the concert started at 7:30. My transit experience was quite hectic, with the train station at Union Square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Square,_Manhattan" target="_self">Union Square</a> being crowded which was expected. Many people from every direction walking. I had to look for the train signs, specifically uptown N and R towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Hills,_Queens" target="_self">Forest Hills</a>. I was also repeatedly checking my maps app to make sure I was going the right direction. Having never been to MSG, I was afraid that I’d take the wrong train which I have before a couple of times, especially during a rush hour. Fortunately I did take the correct train. When walking out, I had to navigate to the arena. The sky was dark already but the area was well lit with restaurants and lights on the sides of the streets. I was relatively east to navigate as I got closer, seeing signs with “Madison Square Garden” written on them. I eventually came across a huge poster on the side of the arena itself of Conan Gray. I was reassured to find my way and took a picture of it. Once I arrived to the front of the arena, I had to go through a security check. There were also multiple entry points. </p>
<p> I mainly found my way inside by following the crowds of people. The security check involved my belongings in a box and walking through the metal detector. Funnily, I was wearing a BB belt <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CTL-Rhinestone-Western-Cowgirl-Leather/dp/B0C77PC1VB " target="_self">BB belt</a>
  which buzzed through the metal detector. It was followed by a security guard scolding me to turn around as he scanned me with a device. I was let through, scanned my ticket on my phone, and went up multiple escalators to get to the floor where my seat was located. The floor was very regal, reminiscent of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater" target="_self">movie theater</a> where things were being sold. There were merch booths, <a href="https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden/food-drink" target="_self">food, drinks</a> and long lines of people waiting. I bought a pretzel and water when I got inside.  I then went to find my seat which was more of a hassle than I initially expected it to be. Because it was so dark and the opening act was playing, it was hard to tell what the seat numbers were. Many people were already in their seats and i confused the seat number with aisle number. It was a very overstimulating environment to say the least.</p>

  <p> I eventually got to my seat. I had a great view and was relatively close to the stage. The show was sold out so I was excited. The opening act was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maisie_Peters" target="_self">Maisie Peters</a>. I wasn’t aware of her music prior but I did enjoy her set. After her performance, it was about 30 minutes to an hour before Conan’s set started. It was a very thrilling set of performances. There a rush of cool air throughout the night and bright lights/lasers emitting from the stage setup. There were stage props and outfit changes. There were also bits in between performances where he’d just talk to everyone, which reinforced how authentic he is apart for the pop star image that’s often portrayed. The crowd was engaged throughout with people standing, singing, dancing, recording, holding their phone flashes up, etc. It reminded me why I enjoy attending concerts. The atmosphere is unlike no other. The massive crowds and people being mesmerized by the artistry in front of them. There’s nothing else that compares to the concert atmosphere, and I’m very grateful to cherish and experience it. </p>
