<h1> Sensory Collection Entry - 9/30/24 </h1>

<p> What struck me about this experience was the individuality of this specific boba spot. I had looked up videos on Instagram and TikTok of it before going in person. I knew that this spot was unique because of the presentation when purchasing a drink. Iâ€™d seen that your order can be given to you from an outside window which opens and plays music. Additionally, there are boba deals which come with plush toys. I was initially surprised by how near it was to my school (the New School). From a business perspective this makes sense which I realized even more when I visited it in person. </p>
