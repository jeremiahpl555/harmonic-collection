    <h1> Sensory Collection Entry - 11/24/24 </h1>
    <p>Upon seeing the “Making Home - Smithsonian Design Triennial” at the Cooper Hewitt museum, I didn’t have any context of what the collection was about. I quickly became invested in the atmosphere of each space on the three levels, sectioned off. One of my personal favorite areas of the exhibition was the “Is a Biobank a Home?” on the second floor. It was one of the most immersive rooms because it was sectioned off and completely held the space of a smaller room with white walls and bright lighting. There was music playing in the room as well and it had a very ominous vibe, similar to the liminal space internet aesthetic. It felt unique in comparison to everything else in the exhibition and more of an abstract concept with the fake viles of blood. It had a larger impact on me because of it being slightly disturbing while feeling important because of its subject matter. I found myself fully immersed in the installations without reading too much into what exactly they were about. However, the quote from the flier for the exhibit states, “Featuring 25 installations, Making Home explores design’s role in shaping the physical and emotional realities of home across the United States, US territories and Tribal Nations.” I respect this three level exhibit so much because of its importance on a broader level with references to cultures like indigenous and Puetro Rican, which I’m glad to see being part Puerto Rican myself. </p>
    <p>I also enjoyed how diverse the exhibition was with its artwork, while still having a level of cohesiveness in the themes revolving around home. There was a combination of more abstract art pieces while others were more simple in composition/material. The range of objects and stories told explores how home can take on a variety of meaning, all depending on one’s perception and personal upbringing.</p>
<p>The first level, titled “Going Home” had a vintage yet luxurious  look to it. The objects and interior style architecture gave me roaring 20s/The Great Gatsby vibes. There was old style furniture and other objects that fit into the living room aesthetic like framed photos, carpeting, lamps, etc. One object that I was quite intrigued by was a golden telephone. I was mainly drawn to it because gold is my favorite color (LOL). It was a standout piece because it fit the theme of the home aesthetic while leaning into the lavish design style with its reflective quality. I find it interesting how some design elements like something being gold are attributed to modern styles or a specific social class no matter what era they were created in. This level had a warm quality to it, and felt as if I was exploring my grandparents secret mansion filled with one of a kind items that wouldn’t exist anywhere else. The rooms were also quite small which added to the intimate atmosphere of looking at the objects. You’d also pass other visitors of the museum quite often. There was life to this specific part of the exhibition, but also a sense of emptiness. There’s something strange about objects being left behind and stories that are passed on. Legacy is intertwined with tragedy and so much more. There are stories in everything around us and I found myself finding a lot of meaning in these objects. A strong introduction to the overall exhibition.</p>
<p>The second floor was titled “Seeking Home” which as I’d previously mentioned also had a strong message, further paying homage to different cultures. There was another section with artworks from painter William Scott, highlighting the Black community. There was a nice stylistic quality about them. I also noticed a painting in a different room on the wall with writing that stated, “70% of homes in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed including X’s SOURCE UNITED NATIONS MARCH 2024”. It’s very saddening to see the war that’s been happing in Palestine, but it’s so important that the impact continues to be part of our conversations. It’s such a devastating issue for humanity overall. What’s happened to Palestine is horrifying, and the artwork reinstates the atrocities of the events. Seeing this made me realize just how important this exhibition truly is. </p>

<p>The third floor included the final part of the exhibition titled “Building Home”. I noticed the checkered mint and white carpeting at first which I enjoyed. There was more of a contemporary vibe to this level. With a focus on modern architecture and community on the local level, it was a nice juxtaposition to the rest of the exhibition while still having cohesion. It also felt more spacious compared to the other levels with more room to walk around. There was a part of the exhibition with a sign that invited visitors to sit on benches and comfy chairs. Overall, it felt like the perfect conclusion to “Making Home”. </p>
