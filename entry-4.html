  <h3>BobaBox2  + Arcade
  </h3>
  <p> What struck me about this experience was the individuality of this specific boba spot. I had looked up videos on Instagram and TikTok of it before going in person. I knew that this spot was unique because of the presentation when purchasing a drink. I’d seen that your order can be given to you from an outside window which opens and plays music. Additionally, there are boba deals which come with plush toys. I was initially surprised by how near it was to my school (the New School). From a business perspective this makes sense which I realized even more when I visited it in person. </p>
<p> Being close in proximity to Union Square, I knew that the environment would be overstimulating depending on the time of day. The larger crowds essentially means more people which brings more business overall. The presentation outside of the store helps as well. With boba drink deals being available to pick up from outside, the products of the store are exposed to the general public and anybody passing by. </p>
<p> I found myself unaware exactly of where to enter when I first arrived. My confusion amplified my sensory experience as I was more inclined to figure out the entrance and where to go based on visual clues. There was a group of people waiting outside, and a worker standing next to a digital order screen. I was waiting behind them for a couple minutes, only to realize they were having a conversation with the worker rather than ordering. I looked through the see through glass doors of the arcade and saw another digital order screen inside. I decided to use that one instead. I found the placement of the screen odd as anybody passing by could see what I was going to order, along with my payment method (LOL). The navigation of the digital order screen was straightforward. After paying, it had navigated me to wait outside as it printed my receipt. I went back outside and the worker asked me if I was told how the drink pick up works. I nodded no. They explained to me that when my order number lights up on the screen, the button will light up. I then have to press the button for the drink to be revealed with the plush toy that comes with it in the deal package. I had waited for around five minutes, with people passing by. This waiting period was odd because there were so many people walking by as I waited outside. It was evening time, around 7. It felt foreign to wait outside because I could hear the footsteps behind me and there was no real waiting area besides the sidewalk itself. Once my order was ready, I walked to the red button that lit up and pushed it. I was unprepared for how attention grabbing the experience would be.  The wall had a light up graphic that slowly slid down. Immediately, a loud speaker was playing the song Kill This Love by BLACKPINK. The drink and plush toy were on a small platform that spun around. The music lasted for about 30 seconds. The loudness of the music definitely drew people attention walking by. While being somewhat of a jarring experience, it did get a smile out of me. I picked up my drink and plush toy, thanked the worker, and walked inside to play the claw machines. I ended up asking for 5 coins, with each coin being a dollar. Interestingly, there was no one else playing inside, with someone walking out as I walked in. I had every claw machine to myself and scouted out all of them before deciding which ones to play. The atmosphere was very enticing the neon lights on each machine changing color. There were many different options, which made it difficult to decide which ones I wanted to play. What stood out to me was the choice of the white interior because it made everything inside seem brighter. I typically equate arcades with a darker interior which creates a different type of atmosphere. Still, I found myself engaged with the games. I finally decided to play one by inserting the coins. It was two coins for one play so I could only actually play two games in total with the five coins I had. On the first game, I did not win but on the second game, I won a yellow dog plushie. After putting my last coin in a random machine, I returned the basket for the coins I’d received to the workers and left. Overall, an interesting sensory experience.
