<h1> Sensory Collection Entry 2 - 9/13/24</h1>
    <h3>MoMA PS1 + Gantry Plaza State Park </h3>
    <p>Sensory details - Museum to Park </p>
    <p> There were many sensory details on my visit to the <a href="https://www.momaps1.org/en"target="_self">MoMA PS1</a>. When walking through the entry doors that led to the exhibit, I was met with a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/mrstainglass/eerie-atmosphere/"target="_self">haunting atmosphere</a>. There was a vast empty area, reminiscent of a <a href="https://www.kidonthetown.com/locations/moma-ps1/"target="_self">playground</a> with giant building blocks and benches. It felt as if I had walked  into the set of a Squid Game challenge. There was no one around as I walked on the pathway. The ground underneath the blocks and benches featured stones, similarly to mulch that would accompany a playground. The weather was very hot and the sun was shining directly on me. There was a stark difference between the outside area and the inside of the museum. It’s also worth mentioning that this museum is at an abandoned school. The museum did have an originality to it with its interior. The colors of the walls were an off white-shade while the floor was brown. The inside of the museum featured different rooms with some having more air conditioning than others. I felt more inclined to stay near the ones with arid conditioning. There were not many people there which further added to the haunting feel of it all. The pieces of art were also all very different from each other, allowing for different sensory experiences to come through based on visual form.

    <h3>Park arrival</h3>
    <h4>Below is a list of sensory experiences I wrote down while sitting at Gantry Plaza State Park</h4>
<p>i remove my thoughts 
  i choose to live right now
  this very moment belongs to me 
  and nobody else
  nothing can take this moment away from me
  nothing before matters
  nothing after matters 
  
  i see bees in the grass 
  i see trees
  i see the back of the pepsi cola sign
  i see people
  i hear planes
  i hear conversation
  children shouting 
  a playground 
  
  this space feels like a pinnacle 
  i see a small weenie dog catching a ball from its owner 
  an orange ball
  i see boats 
  going quicker than i imagined in my head 
  i see weeds and grass 
  green is present 
  green is prominent 
  the green soothes me
  makes me feel alive
  it makes me emotional
  
  i look at my matcha drink melting 
  the colors blend together yet are separate
  the different shades of green and white 
  beautiful 
  lots of dogs and their owners 
  people tanning
  the splashing of water
  a city ambience
  sirens 
  echoing as if this piece of land is intertwined with a man made world
  nature coexisting
